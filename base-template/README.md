Template Details
================

This is a minimum template necessary to have a JRuby Rack App. It
includes the following files:

  * app.rb - Your application
  * config.ru - The minimum Rackup config file.  Set your details for
    deployment here
  * Rakefile - This basically just includes the Torquebox Rake gems for use
    with Rake.  For instance, you can see all of the Torquebox options by
    typing `jruby -S rake -T` or `jruby -S rake -D` to see a description of the
    Torquebox tasks
