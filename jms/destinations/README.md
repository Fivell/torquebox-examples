Destinations
============
See the Torquebox documentation for an explanation, but destinations are
synonymous with topics and queues.  There's much more detailed documentation
for what topics and queues are, but this `torquebox.yml` file will define
  2 topics, 2 queues:

  * topic - nick_topic
  * topic - second_topic
  * queue - nick_queue
  * queue - second_queue

See the `messaging-receiver/` and `messaging-sender/` for examples on how to
work with these destinations.
